    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>I hope you and your family are doing well. My name is Kaan Cebir, and I am a junior mechanical engineering student at Katip Çelebi University in Türkiye. My goal in pursuing mechanical engineering is not merely to work in a manufacturing setting, but to become an engineer who possesses a deep understanding of both science and engineering.</p>

    <p>I have a strong passion for research and a desire to contribute to advanced technologies, particularly in the field of aerospace and turbomachinery. I firmly believe that this is the most meaningful way I can contribute to humanity.</p>

    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have actively participated in various engineering and research projects. In my first year, I joined the Formula Student R&D Team, conducting structural research on chassis design methodologies. I also completed an internship at Janoschka Aegean Cylinder Industry and Trade Inc.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, I collaborated with a master’s student at my university on CFD analyses of a hydrodynamic journal bearing. Currently, I am working at a startup company with Assoc. Prof. Sercan Acarer on gas turbine blade cooling systems. In this project, I performed computational analyses of the blade’s leading edge and conducted a parametric study, followed by symbolic regression to model cooling performance.</p>

    <p>My research interests include turbines, computational fluid dynamics, and optimization. I am particularly interested in wind turbines and would be honored to learn more about experimental techniques and methods used in this field.</p>

    <p>I hope to contribute meaningfully to a research group and gain experience in impactful scientific work. Please feel free to reach out to me if any suitable research opportunities are available.</p>
